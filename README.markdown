# jquery.placeholderlabels
This is yet another placeholder plugin.  It works similarly to tumblr's, and is a total rip off of this: http://jsfiddle.net/mrcoles/Kwsts/

I needed slight variations, and (I think) tightened the code up a bit.

# Usage
Including the js file in an html document will automatically apply to any input/textarea which has a placeholder attribute specified.
